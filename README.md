# PartyPlacer
Planning a party and knowing where to place entertainment items can be difficult. 

PartyPlacer allows you to view party rental items in AR before ordering online. 

The goal of introducing AR is to bridge the gap between what is _digital_ and what is _real_ by casting the product in the space around you.
